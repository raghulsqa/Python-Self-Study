student_names=[]  //declaring a list
student_names=['Mark',"Raghul","shiv"] //List elements
students_names[0]== //accessing through index
students_names[2]==shiv //aacessing through
We can access through  negative index values as -1 -2 -3

students_names[-1]==shiv
students_names[-2]==Raghul//accessing elements through negative index value.

Replace a names in list
students_names[1]=Rocky //Student name in index 1 wil be replaced.

Slicing of elements in list
students_names = ["Mark " ,"Raghul" ,"Homer"]
students_names[1:]==["Raghul","Homer"]//Slicing with index values(i.e it will ignore the first element)
sudents_names[1:-1] == ["Raghul"]//slicing with index values (i.e it will ignore first and lat element)
